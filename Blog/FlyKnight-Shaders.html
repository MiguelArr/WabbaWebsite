            In November of 2023 I made a game called FlyKnight for a friendly gamejam. The gamejam lasted 2 whole weeks and the game 
            was this sort of blend between Shadow Tower Abbyss (a Kings-Fields like) and Dark Souls. It also used old school Runescape-like
            graphics which is what I want to talk about today.

          <p class="readable-paragraph">
            One of the challenges I set to myself was to make the game <strong class="rainbow-text">without textures and lighting</strong>, I thought that it would
            help recreate the style better and it was an interesting to tackle. <br><br>
            As always I used Unreal Engine and its rendering method its build with the idea that you will create a pretty realistic game that uses many modern graphic methods, so, by default all materials/shaders in unreal are set up so they have color, specular, roughness,
            metalness, emissive and normal map, but I don't want none of that, but before we know what we need, lets:

          </div>
          <img src="FlyKnight shaders/osrs_1.png">
          <p class="readable-paragraph">This is a shot of a random cave in Old School Runescape <strong class="rainbow-text"> (OSRS)</strong>, I'm going to list the things I like about it:
            <ul>
                <li>Flat colors</li>
                <li>Everything seems vertex painted, no textures used</li>
                <li>"Steppy style" shading, very visible on the ground, transitioning from dark to light</li>
                <li>Low-poly, stylised</li>
                <li>Sparse use of assets to break monotony like rocks on the ground, mushrooms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Things I don't like:</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Steppy shading not visible on the character</li>
                <li>Lack of depth, all the scene flatly unlit</li>
                <li>A bit stingy in asset/color variety, could use more vegetation for example</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="readable-paragraph">On top of this I have some gripes on other areas of the game, if we take a look at Lumbridge for example:
</p>
            <img src="FlyKnight shaders/osrs_2.png">
            <p class="readable-paragraph">
            I really dislike the use of textures whenever they are used: the bridge, the castle, the water, the treetops, the rooftops, 
            I think it's <strong class="bloody-bold">  awful!</strong> <br><br>
            I understand that the developers didn't feel good about leaving certain surfaces flat or didn't have 
            the tricount budget to make stylised trees that use more polygons to simulate leafs and branches. But since the game rebooted in 2013 the new areas it has gotten 
            use mostly flat shaded vertex painted models with no sparse use of polygons when needed which looks very good I think.
            </p>

        <p class="readable-paragraph">
            So, now that we've reviewed our objectives, let's put things in practise shall we.
            <div class="centered-text">
                <h1 class="bouncing-text" style="font-family: Poetsen One;color: rgb(250, 0, 96)">IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
            </div>    
            I'll be starting with this scene, notice that the assets are smooth shaded and sharp edges are rarely used.
        </p>
        <img src="FlyKnight shaders/HighresScreenshot00000.png">
        <p class="readable-paragraph">
            At the moment this is only using a directional and a skylight which I will now delete. And we 
            proceed with unlit materials that show only vertex colors, which we've painted either in engine or 
            in Blender.<br><br>Don't worry too much about the character using higher values in the color, that's made on purpose 
            so it stands out later.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;align-items: center;">
            <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/HighresScreenshot00001.png">
            <br>
            <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/FK_Shader01.PNG">
        </div>

    <p>Since we're not using lights or fog, we should address first the problem of Depth Perception, to simulate it 
        we can start by just making a sphere radius area from our camera.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;align-items: center;">
        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/HighresScreenshot00010.png">
        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/FK_Shader02.PNG">
    </div>

    <p>The props still look flat, to bring their shading into the mix we can just get the PixelNormalWS on the Blue channel.<br>
    In the following example, I'm lerping it between 0.5,1 to avoid areas of maximum darkness.</p>
        
    <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;align-items: center;">
        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/HighresScreenshot00002.png">
        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="FlyKnight shaders/FK_Shader03.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>Now for the most important part of the process, the secret sauce, the <strong class="rainbow-text">Steppy style</strong>, and it's very 
        simple to achieve, we just need to pass our shading mask through this:
    </p>
    <img src="FlyKnight shaders/FK_Shader04.PNG">
    <p>After this you can tweak your mask to your hearts content to get the results you want, I clamped some values
        and reduced the contrast between the high and low values, and it looks pretty swell.
    </p>
    <img src="FlyKnight shaders/HighresScreenshot00006.png">
    <p>I recommend you use different shaders for characters, props and environment terrain. I like to have a different shader for characters and lerp 
        the vertex normal WS info with a vector to simulate that they are shaded from a different angle. Or get the distance field 
        information in the terrain shader to simulate ambient occlusion, it's very versatile!<br><br>
        I'm aware that some of these things can be achieved with postprocess, but in this project I used Forward shaders, which prevent the use of PP materials, I did this because 
        I was trying to make a very performant game, didn't quite turn out that way because in 2 weeks I didn't have time to optimise.
        Oh well.
        <br><br>
        Anyway that's all for this blog, I'll do one in the future talking about the framey animation style 
        and some other stuff too probably. <strong class="rainbow-text"></strong> Peace!
