<p class="readable-paragraph"> Ever since I made my Kickstarter campaign in October of 2023 I've been having a few thoughts
    tumbling around in my brain. I want to properly internalise them and put them out there.
</p>
<iframe class="window-border" style="width: 100%; height: 50vw; max-width: 1024px; max-height: 576px;align-self: center;"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VXFJA7C6vA?si=ZqI56XmJBPSjShMI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="readable-paragraph">
Before the campaign started I thought I had been diligent with preparations, I had researched months in advance, I had been using the platform for several
years, I knew what to expect to some extent. In hindsight there are many many things that could have been done better, and not even in hindsight, at the time I knew 
that my capsule art was ass, everyone knows it's an important piece of the campaign but for several reasons I had to make do with what I had, which I thought and still think
that it's "okay", not horrid but good enough.
</p>
<p class="readable-paragraph">
I had put together a decent page, whith all the info the people need but quite condensed and decorated so it wasn't a chore to read through. The rewards 
were also well laid out, sadly I don't have much to offer in tems of rewards: copies of the game, some physical goodies, the chance of having a portrait or note written by the backer,
stuff like that, it seemed enough.
<br><br>
I had collected a few project followers, I don't remember how many there were, I believe about 400, which is a rather low number, I think any number below 1000 is low, but getting new eyes
on the project before it launched was a pretty tough affair with the means I had.
<br><br>
I had about 4k followers on twitter, seemed like enough for a decent start and enough for a chance of getting RT by more influential people.
<br><br>
The minimum goal I had in mind was rather low for a game project, 20k, but it was the minimum I'd need to fund the next 2 or so years of development. I also figured that
it being a mainly PC product my audience was rather limited, I'm aware that things in consoles can have much more success, specially those on <strong class="bloody-bold">  nintendo</strong> platforms.
</p>
<p class="readable-paragraph">
And then the campaign launched, throughought the next month getting to the goal was a long fought battle and it wasn't until the 28th day of campaign that it got funded.<br>
Which means that, even having done a decent amount of homework, just getting to the goal was a struggle, and I want to talk about why this is went down like it did and why it isn't normal and what is going on with Kickstarter 
because it's rather obvious to me that <strong class="rainbow-text">something is happening</strong>, don't worry, I don't mean it in a nutjob conspirational sort of way, it's a product of
many factors, which I need to lay down first.
</p>
<p class="readable-paragraph">
Before I get into the weeds of the matter I want to say that I'm incredibly thankful and relieved that things turned out the way they did, that said I do believe I deserve it, I'm 
prideful about few things in life and Sorceress is one of those. I't something I've poured into many years of my life and the result is something unique that feels 
really good to play and it's super fun for both long time fans and newcomers to the genre.

<p class="readable-paragraph">
If you take a gander at this graph, you'll notice that it's mostly a smooth curve upwards with a good bump at the end when it got past the finish line.<br>
At the time I thought this was very unique, several projects I had looked into it had a much different pattern, usually having a much stronger start, a much weaker middle point, and then seeing some 
action at the end but perhaps not as much.<br><br>
 Like many fools that embark on the Kickstarter journey I had hoped to get funded first week and then just be content and dig for scraps to meet 
some stretch goals as long as the campaign was active, but instead of digging for scraps I had to be digging for gold to get to the minimum in the first place.
<br><br>
So why was it so tought to get funded? Was the game not unique? Not well presented? Was the campaign itself not that exciting? Was the capsule art REALLY that bad?<br>
Well, some of these things are true to some extent, but, in plain terms, I don't think the game itself is at fault here. After all, many projects that are worse presented, of more generic-looking games 
that don't even feature something playable have gotten funded throughout Kickstarter with no problem at all throughought the years.<br><br>
I think that at some point in recent years there has been a sort of inflexion point that has lead to projects like mine to struggle with the platform that I think
it's getting worse to the point where many will not even stand a chance in the very near future.

People are not as willing to contribute to a campaign as they used to
