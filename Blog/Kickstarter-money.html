              <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wabba/sorceress">In October of 2023 I ran a KICKSTARTER campaign</a> for my game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168070/Sorceress/" target="_blank">Sorceress</a>, 
              it went well, it met its goal and then some more, it was a taxing experience and I learned a lot from it. Why use Kickstarter in the first place though?<br> Well, you can't answer this question without talking about money and publishers 
              and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the many thoughts I have on these matters...<br><br>
              So, as far as I can tell, as an indie developer these are your options: 
              <br><br>
          </p>
            <div class="centered-text">
                <h1 class="bouncing-text" style="font-family: Poetsen One;color: rgb(200, 0, 250)">Option 1:</h1>
                <h1 class="bouncing-text" style="font-family: Poetsen One;color: rgb(200, 0, 250)">Fund it Yourself</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="readable-paragraph">A scary thought isn't it.<br>
                Jokes aside, if you can afford it is the best thing you can do. No strings attached, no deadlines, no one to answer to.
                This can be bad to some people but I'm used to cook on my own at my pace and I'm not a perfectionist so I know I'd get it done 
                someday somehow. <br><br>
                The main problem is that the game needs many things I'm bad at: concept art, 3D animation, music... these are things I don't even
                try to do on my own. While I don't doubt that they would be fun and all, it's just not realistic to think that I can cover every aspect
                of a game this size in a reasonable timeframe. I live in a privileged enough situation that while I do have groceries and bills to pay, I don't 
                need to worry too much about sustaining myself, I expect to do that with savings I've hoarded over the 3 years I've spent working as a 3D 
                artist. <br><br>
                So, I was looking at a few years left of development, and I saw I couldn't pay for my game, what other options are there?

            <h1 class="bouncing-text" style="font-family: Poetsen One;color: rgb(250, 0, 62)">Get a Publisher</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="readable-paragraph">Now THAT sends chill down my spine.<br><br>
So, on one hand I got a bone to pick with publishers, on the other I don't have personal experience working with them, so take
my opinions with as much salt as you like, here they go:<br><br>
I used to think that publishers were good. The general belief is that they give you funding and closely work with you so you 
make the best game that you can without worrying about money and they will help with stuff, people mostly seem to think that 
they deal with marketing, that they have a great reach to get your game in players' hands. Well, some of these things are true 
but it isn't that easy. <br>
The main reason someone teams up with a publisher is because they need money, most publishers will operate under a deadline system 
where the developer signs in a contract that they'll get to certain stages of development in time before getting a new round of funding 
rolls in. I think this is a bit cutthroat but it does make sense. The developer agrees that they will take this seriously and the publisher 
promises that as long as these things are met everything will be fine... until we factor in that a publisher can meddle in development: 
ask for changes, request features, ask for demos under tight deadlines. These are things that can seriously impact the course of 
development and can be used maliciously to force you to screw up your contract, so now they might give you less funding and have you grabbed 
by the balls.<br><br>
But why would a publisher screw you over? You both have the same goal, for the best possible game to release and for as many players 
as possible to buy it. Well, here is where it gets tricky.<br><br>

A lot of publishers, even those bigger ones you're thinking of, release many games with little to no fanfare, but then release others 
that everyone and their granma has heard about through viral tweets, youtube ads, sponsored youtubers, etc. I think that under a contract 
with a publisher, no developer is equal. If they sign a contract with 5 developers and only one of the games is making a splash on social media, 
that's the one they will focus on, there is a limited amount of noise they can make with the money they invest in marketing, and a limited 
amount of reach they have to their followers, so they will try to make each attempt count, and, if you're not in their good graces you might just 
get left out. But they might keep you around just in case your game does have success.<br>
It may sound strange that they will leave out a developer they have partenered with but there are a few other reasons they might do this, maybe the 
developer isn't meeting deadlines, maybe their game is turning out badly, maybe they never felt that strongly about it and were just signing up without thinking much of it.<br><br>
And then when a published game releases what usually happens is that the developer will not see a cent of the money the game makes until they have 
paid back the publisher all the money they have lent them so far, this is the recoup. After that, you'll usually split earnings 50/50, and some contracts change over time 
so after 5 years or so you'll get full earnings for the game, which can be good if you develop a dlc or sequel, but that's rare to see.<br><br>
I used to think that this recoup thing wasn't normal, that splitting earnings 50/50 was enough risk but no, it is normal, the developer HAS to pay it back 
but sometimes they will let you have some of the money that comes in before it's all paid for, so at least you can get a sandwhich to eat every now and then.<br><br>
So, from my perspective, this whole publisher deal doesn't really sound that much like a partnership, it's mostly a business agreement that maybe has some perks.<br><br>
Now, I've read and heard enough publisher horror stories to arrive to these conclussions, but with all of that said: I'm not against the idea of going 
with a publisher.<br>
It can be justified and for many people has worked, good for them! Hell if I had no other choice I would go with a publisher,
they can take care of many things that sound very boring to me like managing social media accounts, porting the game to consoles, localizing it 
in different languages, outsourcing talent needed for it... ideally they have contacts and have been in the industry longer than you, that can be a good deal.<br>
But, I've just spent quite a bit of space describing the headaches that comes with that, what if we could avoid them?

    Wouldn't it be great if you could get funded by people that just want to support you and let you cook on your own terms while only 
    asking back for your cool ass game on release (and perhaps some extra perks)?

    That's what crowdfunding is good for. Still, it's been the better part of a year since I did my campaign and I feel a balanced amount of 
    pressure to deliver updates and consistently make progress. A little pressure ensures that I don't
    slack off or work on experimental stuff that will likely get scrapped, and it's better than the pressure that a publisher would 
    put on my shoulders, with many other upsides.<br> It feels balanced, it's nice.<br><br>
    There aren't a lot of other downsides I can think of. The people that have backed the campaign will receive a key, Steam will flag this as "Product Received for Free" 
    and if they review the game it won't count toward the real numbers that the platform tracks but this is like such an insignificant problem that 
    really I'm just searching for scraps to play devils advocate here.<br><br>
    The main real downside was making the campaign itself, producing the assets for it, getting into business mode, growing an audience beforehand 
    and just the whole process was very emotionally exhausting and I felt quite bad about it while it was running, but I want to save these thoughts for a different blog entry.<br><br>
    I will admit that while doing the campaign I felt how nice it would be to have a publisher, I was editing video, finishing the demo, solving bugs, sending emails, investigating other
    campaigns, tweeting daily... there is much more that I could've done but just with that it was starting to get overwhelming and I can see how a publisher could help with all of this, not
    specifically with producing a crowdfunding campaign but managing all the things that aren't "making the game itself".

    Having to deal with business stuff sucks and I'd rather just make the game in peace but I'm glad and thankful it went the way I wanted.
    In the future I'll make a more detailed blog about Kickstarter, thanks for reading!!
