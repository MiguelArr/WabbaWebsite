              <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wabba/sorceress">In October of 2023 I ran a KICKSTARTER campaign</a> for my game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168070/Sorceress/" target="_blank">Sorceress</a>, 
              it was successful, it met its goal and then some more, it was a taxing experience and I learned a lot from it. Why use Kickstarter in the first place though? Well, it all began near the end of 2018...
              <br><br>
              At the time I was warming up to the idea of being an indie dev, I had been working on my game for a few months
              and at that point it was a broken mess but I believed in its potential, I had just finished playing The Return of the Obra Dinn at the time and I wondered how long had that game took to make.
              The answer was 4 years, and at the time I was surprised by this: it's a game excellentely designed, scored and put together but it's definitely humble in its presentation with a lo-fi 
              graphic style, my goal with Sorceress wasn't to make a triple A looking thing but it would be far from low fidelity, so I figured that it would take me no less than 5 years to make the game 
              I wanted to make, which at the time was a crushing revelation.<br><br>
