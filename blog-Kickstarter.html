      <br><br>
        In October of 2023 I ran a KICKSTARTER campaign for my game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168070/Sorceress/" target="_blank">Sorceress</a>, 
        it was successful, it met its goal and then some more, it was a taxing experience, I learned a lot from it and I'd like to share it.
        <br><br>
        If you're a game developer doing something somewhat big and somewhat complicated, sooner or later you're going to need money to keep going, that much
        is obvious, now, as a game developer you have a few different trees you can shake to get that dough, some devs live in a comfortable situation and can just
        peacefully work while either having constant revenue or enough savings. <br><br>Other devs either approach or get approached by a publisher that offers funding and probably
        other things too to sweeten the deal, this can come with a lot of caveats and I have many things to say about this, but this is not the time.
        <br><br>
        Which brings me to a third option, getting funded by the people, and the commons way of doing this are crowdfunding and/or releasing your game in Early Access.
        I don't have enough of a game to satisfy Early Access so I went the crowdfunding route, I've had some friends have great success with this so I went with this route.

    <p>The initial goal was 20kâ‚¬, a suficient amount for a solo dev living in Spain rent-free. On top of living
       expenses and taxes I wanted to comission people to do things that I can't, such as music, animations, concept art and help
       out in other areas too. At the time of writting that's exactly what I'm doing, though I'm being very careful with my spending
       as I got fucked by taxes harder than I was expecting, but that's kind of okay since the goal went 5kâ‚¬ over the line.
       <br><br>
       I started my research on Kickstarter about 6 months from launching it, in april 2023, investigated other campaigns, trying to
       get inspired and getting in the culture and mentality. At the time my friends over at Genokids were running their own campaign
       which went very well for them, they amassed 85kâ‚¬ which is totally deserved, I didn't hope getting near that amount, but it would've
       been real nice.

      <p>This is more or less the point where I started. Their campaign is well constructed, their trailer kicks ass
        and they are targetting a pretty broad audience which they know very well. <br> So I figured out an aesthetic that would work for 
        my game for banners and stuff and did the basic writting which I tweaked over the following months as I let it sit and read again
        with a different perspective.

<div>  <br><br> As a small game developer present in social media
      you are in a pretty good position to get involved in the communities your game would be part of and just naturally hang out
      in them, soaking the culture and being part of it. Not necessarily with the goal of just shilling your game in someones playground
      but just enjoying your time in it and naturally share what you do
