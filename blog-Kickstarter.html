        <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wabba/sorceress">In October of 2023 I ran a KICKSTARTER campaign</a> for my game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168070/Sorceress/" target="_blank">Sorceress</a>, 
        it was successful, it met its goal and then some more, it was a taxing experience and I learned a lot from it. Why use Kickstarter in the first place though? Well, it all began near the end of 2018...
        <br><br>
        At the time I was warming up to the idea of being an indie dev, I had been working on my game for a few months
        and at that point it was a broken mess but I believed in its potential, I had just finished playing The Return of the Obra Dinn at the time and I wondered how long had that game took to make.
        The answer was 4 years, and at the time I was surprised by this: it's a game excellentely designed, scored and put together but it's definitely humble in its presentation with a lo-fi 
        graphic style, my goal with Sorceress wasn't to make a triple A looking thing but it would be far from low fidelity, so I figured that it would take me no less than 5 years to make the game 
        I wanted to make, which at the time was a crushing revelation.<br><br>

        The game wasn't much at the time and I wasn't even sure of what was I capable of as a programmer but I wanted to keep working on it and get it to a good state.
        I was back to living with my parents after I came back from the most boring job I've ever had, while money wasn't a pressing issue but I didn't want to leech off my parents for too long, 
        so it was time to get employed, again. <br> 
        Throughought 2019 I improved my skills as a 3D artist and made 2 portfolio pieces that showed I was a decent artist, capable of getting 
        a place in the games industry as a junior enviro artist: <br>

      To make these I received some help with a friend that was already in a big dick company, I went to his house and he just showed me his process, and it was a simpler thing than I thought,
      mostly I just saw him make a surface material going layer by layer and explaining to me how he imagined the asset to have been weathered until he had something on the screen that looked as 
      if you could reach and touch it. On my own I approached my asset in a similar manner and it went well, I went back and forth with my friend over a few rounds of feedback until we arrived to
      those results. These assets gave me an interview at the company he was at but I didn't get a job there, instead I got an interview a couple months later at a different place which did employ 
      me and I spent the following 3 years of my life working as a 3D artist in that outsourcing company. And they were pretty good years: The work was fulfilling, I managed to save a money, in some 
      instances I was treating with clients directly, one of them in a position of Lead Artist.
      <br><br>
      While this was happening I was using whatever time I had to spare to work on Sorceress, a lot of people have trouble with this because, well, you just spent 8 hours of your day in front of a computer 
      and spending a few more doesn't sound good. But I guess I'm comfortable enough in here that I was able to chip away at it consistently, helps a lot that my work as a 3D artist and my work as a game 
      developer tapped into different sides of my brain so it wasn't as tiring, I think. While this was going on COVID happened, which made things a lot easier because now I was at home all day, no need to 
      commute!
      <br><br>
      So at some point in late 2022 it seemed like a good time to say my farewells and start pedal to the metal with gamedev so I spent the next year working on a demo.
      
      <br><br>
        Other devs either approach or get approached by a publisher that offers funding and probably
        other things too to sweeten the deal, this can come with a lot of caveats and I have many things to say about this, but this is not the time.
        <br><br>
        Which brings me to a third option, getting funded by the people, and the commons way of doing this are crowdfunding and/or releasing your game in Early Access.
        I don't have enough of a game to satisfy Early Access so I went the crowdfunding route, I've had some friends have great success with this so I went with this route.

    <p class="readable-paragraph">The initial goal was 20kâ‚¬, a suficient amount for a solo dev living in Spain rent-free. On top of living
       expenses and taxes I wanted to comission people to do things that I can't, such as music, animations, concept art and help
       out in other areas too. At the time of writting that's exactly what I'm doing, though I'm being very careful with my spending
       as I got fucked by taxes harder than I was expecting, but that's kind of okay since the goal went 5kâ‚¬ over the line.
       <br><br>
       I started my research on Kickstarter about 6 months from launching it, in april 2023, investigated other campaigns, trying to
       get inspired and getting in the culture and mentality. At the time my friends over at Genokids were running their own campaign
       which went very well for them, they amassed 85kâ‚¬ which is totally deserved, I didn't hope getting near that amount, but it would've
       been real nice.

      <p class="readable-paragraph" style="margin-left: 50px;">This is more or less the point where I started. Their campaign is well constructed, their trailer kicks ass
        and they are targetting a pretty broad audience which they know very well. <br><br> So I figured out an aesthetic that would work for 
        my game for banners and stuff and did the basic writting which I tweaked over the following months as I let it sit and read again
        with a different perspective.

<div class="readable-paragraph">  <br><br> As a small game developer present in social media
      you are in a pretty good position to get involved in the communities your game would be part of and just naturally hang out
      in them, soaking the culture and being part of it. Not necessarily with the goal of just shilling your game in someones playground
      but just enjoying your time in it and naturally share what you do
